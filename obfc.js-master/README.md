Object Based Flow Charts(obfc): Draws SVG-based flow charts by creating objects in your web pages.
obfc.js is an object-based JavaScript Library for drawing SVG flow charts acroos modern web browsers. It makes easily to construct objects, links and connections. Moreover, it dispatches a click event when an object or a line is clicked and descriptions can be added for all clicks.

# SVG Shapes
obfc.js has 24 different SVG shapes that can be divided into four groups:  
* Operation Symbols:Process, Predefined Process, Alternate Process, Delay, Preparation, Manual Operation
* Branching and Control of Flow Symbols:Terminal, Decision, Connector (Inspection), Off-Page Connector, OR, Summing Junction
* Input and Output Symbols: Data, Document, Multi - Document, Display, Manual Input, Card, Punched Tape
* File and Information Storage Symbols: Stored Data, Magnetic Disk, Direct Access - Storage, Internal Storage, Sequential Access Storage - Magnetic Tape

# Usage
To use obfc.js the following:
```javascript
<script src="obfc.js"></script>
```
and then add svg element to body of a web page.
```javascript
<svg id="demo" width="600" height="700"> </svg>
```
and then connect library to the id of the SVG element.
```javascript
<script>
prepare_SVG("demo");
</script>
```
# Creating SVG Shapes
To draw objects, add_theObject function can be used for the given SVG element.
```javascript
<script>
var object1 = add_theObject(new Terminal(300, 50, 1, "Hello obfc.js", 20, "<h3>Description in HTML format</h3>"));
var object2 = add_theObject(new Process(300, 150, 1, ["Line 1", "Line 2"], 10));
</script>
```
add_theObject is a function that adds the object into a given SVG element and returns this object. This returned object is used for drawing lines between two objects. There are 24 different SVG objects in obfc.js. 22 of them contain 9 parameters for creating an object. First two parameters are required, others are optimal. 
```javascript
Object_Name(_middle_x, _middle_y, _size, _text, _text_size, _description, _fill_color, _stroke_color, _text_color);
```
* _middle_x and middle_y: centre of the object. (Required)
* _size: For example, default size of a process object width is 125 and height is 50. _size value is multiplied by these values.
* _text and _text_size: Text is written in the center of an object. This parameter can be defined string value or array["", ""...]. If your text is too long, you can use array for creating lines.
* _description: These value can be coded in HTML format. These value is displayed in a HTML element that contains "desc" id after clicking an object or a line. 
* _fill_color: Default value is white. But, the object color can be determined with this parameter.
* _stroke_color: Default value is black.
* _text_color: Default value is black.
2 of them (OR and  SummingJunction) contain 7 parameter. These objects are not included parameters of _text and _text_size.
Object_Name(_middle_x, _middle_y, _size, _description, _fill_color, _stroke_color, _text_color);

# Creating Lines Between Objects

After creating all objects, objects can be linked by using draw_theLine function.
```javascript
<script>
var o_line1 = draw_theLine(new Line(object1, object2, 1, 0, "Text", 12, "<b>Description in HTML format</b>"));
</script>
```
Line is a function that determines the path for given two objects and their positions. This function has 9 parameters. First two parameter is required and others are optimal.
```javascript
Line(object1, object2, position1, position2, _text, _text_size, _description, _stroke_color, _text_color)
```
* object1 ve object2: are variables that is defined in the previous section.
* position1 and position2: are position information of objects. There are four positions for all shapes. Top=0, Bottom=1, Left=2 and Right=3. But, when these values are not entered or entered "-1", this function automatically determines these position by calculating differences between all unused positions. (Unused position means that this position is used for creating lines)
* _text and _text: text in line. This function selects the longest sub-line for writing text. 
* description, _stroke_color, _text_color: (same with previous section)
